Here we immediately encounter our first difficulty: this is a notebook. and Matplotlib has a peculiar behaviour inside notebooks. It is time to introduce the idea of _backend_ and how matplotlib manages its _backend_ differently inside a notebook. Unfortunately, we have to discuss this before importing matplotlib, because this has to be set immediately. Don't worry, everything will get less technical and more practical from here!\n",

    "Quoting from the matplotlib official documentation (https://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">The “frontend” is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the “backend” does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure. There are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in pygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx; also referred to as “interactive backends”) and hardcopy backends to make image files (PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as “non-interactive backends”).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a backend transforms code into a figure. There are different options to do this, with the main difference being between the hard and the interactive modes. Indeed, a backend will either save the final product on a file (_hard backend_), such as a png file, or show you the plot on screen (_interactive backend_). \n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is smart and will select a working backend for you. Therefore, you will hardly ever notice -- especially if you just want to save a figure. However, it is important we check how backends work because the code you write and the behavior of matplotlib will change implictly depending on how you are running your code (notebook, live coding or script). To write code that reliably produces the results you want, knowing the basics of matplotlib backends is fundamental. For example, how do we translate notebook code to script code?"

To do this we will use the <a href=\"https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/tutorial.html#magics-explained\">magic functions</a> of Ipython (official name!).

Truly interactive backends like `Qt5Agg` (and others) allows you to check what you are doing while you do it. The general rule for plotting in notebooks is \"One block one plot\".

    "\n",
    "Small and fundamental aside about colors. We have set the color of `rect` to gray using the curios `tuple` (0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1). Matplotlib interprets this as an RGBA coordinate. Let's examine what this means. The first three number are the amount of red (R), green (G) and blue (B) in the color -- white, black and all gray colors in between have a equal mixture of these primary colors. The fourth value is the so-called _alpha_ value. It determines the transparency of the color. An _alpha_ of 0 corresponds to completely transparency (that is, an invisible object). An _alpha_ of 1 corresponds to a completely solid object. Anything in between will create a semi-transparent object. \n",

You can find more details in the documentation (<a href=https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/gallery/color/color_demo.html>https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/gallery/color/color_demo.html</a>). In this workshop, we will only use RGBA coordinates and color keywords -- see <a href=https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/gallery/color/named_colors.html>here</a> for a complete list of color keywords.\n",
