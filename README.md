# Matplotlib Workshop
Contains the material for the Matplotlib Summer 2020 Workshop.

The workshop is divided into two parts. Part 1 is about the fundamental syntax of matplotlib. Part 2 shows how to create standard plots (like scatter plots) in matplotlib. Both parts consists of a Jupyter notebook plus external data to be analyzed. The data is contained in this same repository, be sure to download the entire depository.

## Note on Versioning

This workshop was created using Python 3.8.3, Pandas 1.0.1, numpy 1.18.1 and matplotlib 3.1.3. The code was not tested on other versions. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the code will work with different versions of the same software. These are the software version that anaconda official channel currently (August 2020) distributes. You can follow the instructions below to install the software on your machine or you can run the code on Google Collaboratory.

## How to Run the Notebooks
The notebooks require Pandas, matplotlib and numpy. You can use the Google Collaboratory version of the notebooks. 
To use the colaboratory version, it is sufficient to open the following links, let your browser load the file and click on the "open in colab" icon that will appear on top of the file:

1.   [Part 1 on Colab](./matplotlib_workshop_part_I_colaboratory.ipynb)
2.   [Part 2 on Colab](./.ipynb)

If you prefer to use your local machine, then you can create a specific Anaconda environment with this line of code:

`conda create -n matplotlib_workshop matplotlib numpy pandas jupyter`

To activate the environment, you can use

`conda activate geopandas_workshop`

After this, you can download the entire repository with the "clone or download" green button on the right-upper corner of the [repository homepage](https://github.com/non87/Matplotlib-Workshop). Finally, you can use Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab (both included with Ananconda) to open the local versions of the notebooks.

## Exercises

You can find the solutions to the exercises in the following links:

1.   [Solution Exercises Part 1](./solutions/solutions_part_1.ipynb)
2.   [Solution Exercises Part 2](./solutions/solutions_part_2.ipynb)

To see how the solutions work, you will have to copy paste the code in the original notebooks of the first / second part.
